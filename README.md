# Conservative Party of Canada 2017 Leadership Results

This is a dataset of the Conservative Party of Canada 2017 leadership race. I provide both summary results for each geographical region and detailed results for each round for each candidate for each region. These results were scraped off [Conservative.ca](http://conservative.ca/leadership/en/results).

## Contents

`summary_results.csv` is the summary data results, while `detailed_results.csv` is the detailed data results. Each file contains results for 352 areas (338 ridings, 13 provinces and territories, and the national results). Code used to scrape this data and the raw JSON files taken from [Conservative.ca](http://conservative.ca) are also included.
